Pedodiversity = soil diversity.\n
A.	Definition\n
-	how much variability there is in soil properties\n
-	how many different types of soil there are in a particular area\n
-	Example\n
how much nitrogen or magnesium thereâ€™s in the soil in one spot\n
Then compare it with the chemistry of the soil a short distance away\n
\n
B.	Why Important\n
A link between biodiversity and pedodiversity due to the tight relationship between soils and flora and fauna\n
\n
C.	Three main causes of pedodiversity Michigan forests\n
1)	Tree species\n
Different species have different influences on soil formation and soil properties.\n
Example:\n
-	Pine trees drop pine needles, which add a lot of acid to the soil.\n
-	The organic litter of another tree species might add less acid but more of something else.\n
-	More types of trees -> more pedodiversity.\n
2)	Gaps created when trees fall (Gaps = open areas)\n
Soil in gaps/open areas changes.\n
Example:\n
-	Without a tree to offer shade from sunlight, the full intensity of that radiation reaches the ground -> soil heats up\n
-	Without a tree to soak up moisture from the ground -> soil becomes wetter\n
-	Higher temperature & more moist conditions -> organic matter decomposition speeds up.\n
3)	Trees being uprooted\n
Soil attached to the roots will be eventually shed from the roots.\n
-> Drops down and forms a little hill of dirt, a mound (different soil properties)\n
-> Thus, redistribution and mixing of soil as deep roots are ripped up from the ground.\n
\n
D.	Forests management implications\n
Goal: promote pedodiversity by mimicking natural forest processes\n
\n
E.	Assignment\n
Read an article on pedodiversity in a section of forests near here.\n
Article: Just as forest dynamics affects pedodiversity, pedodiversity also affects forest dynamics.\n
